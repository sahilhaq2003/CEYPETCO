        "The existing refinery was built as a hydro-skimming refinery with an original design capacity of 35,000 barrels per day. A later limited expansion increased processing capacity to 50,000 barrels per day to meet domestic petroleum-fuel demand. The SOREM project introduces modern conversion processes that upgrade low-value residual oil into fuels meeting current environmental standards, creating substantial foreign-exchange savings for Sri Lanka.",
