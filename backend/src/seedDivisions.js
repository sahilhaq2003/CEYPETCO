        "The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was established under Act No. 28 of 1961 and entered the import, distribution and marketing of petroleum products throughout the island. The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery was commissioned in August 1969 to process 38,000 barrels per stream day—approximately 5,200 metric tonnes per day—of Iranian Light crude oil",
        "Although the crude distiller's rated capacity was 5,200 MT/day, the unit was capable of processing 5,800 MT/day. Crudes with characteristics similar to Iranian Light, including Upper Zakum and Arabian Light, could be processed while meeting the required specifications",
        "LPG production commenced in 1971, with the Naphtha Merox unit modified to process LPG. Special Boiling Point Solvent production also began using existing facilities. The Crude Distiller was subsequently debottlenecked, increasing refining capacity to 50,000 barrels per stream day—approximately 6,900 MT/day",
        "A new Kerosene Merox unit was commissioned in 1981 to process Jet A-1. The crude distiller was later revamped to process Far Eastern crudes such as Miri Light, while Naphtha Unifiner capacity increased to 1,100 MT/day in 1992. The Platformer was revamped in 1999 to reach 650 MT/day, meet growing gasoline demand and support the phase-out of lead in gasoline",
        "The existing Kerosene Unifiner was converted to process diesel, and the Gas Oil Unifiner was rehabilitated in 2003 to meet a diesel sulphur specification of 0.3% by weight",
        "Small and medium-scale energy-conservation projects have improved operational efficiency. The Utilities section supplies the electricity, water, steam and instrument air required for plant operations. The refinery contains 65 tanks for crude oil, finished products and intermediate products, supported by four additional crude-oil tanks at the Orugodawatta tank farm",
